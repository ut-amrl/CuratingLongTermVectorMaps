# CuratingLongTermVectorMaps
Implementing a few of the algorithms defined in [_Curating Long Term Vector Maps_](https://www.joydeepb.com/Publications/iros2016_ltvm.pdf) by Samer Nashed and Joydeep Biswas. Specifically, we implemented the SDF-Based Filtering and Line Extraction algorithms.


The executables created:
 - SDF-Filter(/bin/sdf_filter)
